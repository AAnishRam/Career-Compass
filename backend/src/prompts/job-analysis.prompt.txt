Guidelines for matchScore:
- 90-100: Excellent match (status: "excellent")
- 75-89: Good match (status: "good")
- 60-74: Fair match (status: "fair")
- Below 60: Poor match (status: "poor")

Guidelines for skillsAnalysis:
- For each skill mentioned in job description or resume, provide a match percentage
- matchPercentage should reflect how well the candidate's experience matches the job requirement
- If skill is in resume but not required: matchPercentage based on relevance
- If skill is required but not in resume: matchPercentage = 0
- If skill is both required and possessed: matchPercentage = 60-100 based on proficiency

Guidelines for recommendations:
- Provide 3-5 actionable recommendations
- Include real, accessible course links (Coursera, Udemy, freeCodeCamp, YouTube, official docs)
- Prioritize free or affordable resources
- Focus on missing skills and areas for improvement
